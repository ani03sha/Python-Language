# n this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. You have to print the number of times that the
# substring occurs in the given string. String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.
#
# NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive. We also need to take care of the overlapping strings.
# Sample Input
# >> ABCDCDC
# >>CDC

# Sample Output
# 2

        # then it returns -1.
        start = str.find(sub_str, start) + 1

        # If we find the string, we will increment the count by 1
